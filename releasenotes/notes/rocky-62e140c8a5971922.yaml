    [`blueprint image-host <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/zun-ui/+spec/image-host>`_]
    To clarify the host that has the image to be operated, `host` parameter was

    Added rebuild action into containers panel as item action. User can rebuild
    container with same or other image.

    New statuses for container, ``DELETING``, ``REBUILDING``, ``DEAD`` and
    ``RESTARTING`` are added.

    New parameters for container, ``disk``, ``availablity_zone`` and ``auto_heal``

    The runtime option for container creation accepts as string.
    Previously the runtime option was a drop down menu with only ``runc`` option.
    User was not able to enter new runtimes configured by them.
    To accept any string, the runtime option was changed to the field.

    [`bug/1777545 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/zun-ui/+bug/1777545>`_]
    Fixed issue the deleted item is selected again with batch delete.
    Item selections on table view for batch actions are not cleared
    after execution of actions. To ensure to clear item selections,
    `hzTable:clearSelection` event is emitted.

    [`bug/1746706 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/zun-ui/+bug/1746706>`_]
    Reproduced navigations when refreshing details view. Previously the fix
    for [`bug/1681627 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1681627>`_]
    allowed us to reload or directly open Angular-based detail page (ngdetail),
    but the navigation menu was not reproduced correctly.

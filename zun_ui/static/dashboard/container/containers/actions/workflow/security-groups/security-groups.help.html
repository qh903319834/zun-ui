      Security groups define a set of IP filter rules that determine
      how network traffic flows to and from a container.
    </p>
    <p translate>
      To create new security groups, go to the <b>Network | Security Groups</b> view,
      then click <b>Create Security Group</b>.
    </p>

      Users can add additional rules to an existing security group
      to further define the access options for a container.
      To create additional rules, go to the <b>Network | Security Groups</b> view,
      then find the security group and click <b>Manage Rules</b>.
    </p>
    <p translate>
      In this dialog, specify the security groups for the container.
      Note that the security groups will only apply for ports that
      will be created from the allocated networks, but will not apply
      for the allocated ports that are pre-existing.
